      <h1>About the Service</h1>
      <p>
        This application uses AI models to assess the risk of heart disease based on entered lifestyle habits and personal information such as BMI.
        The result is only an estimate and not a medical diagnosis. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>
          Always seek the advice of your doctor or other qualified 
          health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical treatment.
        </strong>

      <p>
        The AI model is trained based on a dataset from the Center of Disease Control Behavioural Risk Factors 
        Surveillance System (CDC BRFSS) called "Indicators of Heart Disease". The risk is calculated by an average of three models: SVM and XGBoost, the percentage for each risk factor came from shapley-scores.
        the participants were all US residents,and uses your personal input only for making predictions â€” not for training.
